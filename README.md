# Wordle

[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a web-based word game created and developed by Welsh software engineer Josh Wardle,
and owned and published by The New York Times Company since 2022.
Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word,
with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match
or occupy the correct position.
The mechanics are nearly identical to the 1955 pen-and-paper game Jotto and the television game show franchise Lingo.
Wordle has a single daily solution, with all players attempting to guess the same word.

## Hive Rush aka Team work

### V.1 Assistant Part 

We got this very first side project to work in team.
The task was to create an assistant for wordle game which using wordle database and sorting out the wrong words and listing only
what is still available and possibly the right one, for the user.

With my team mates we considered lot of possible way to start, but in the end we decided to go with ***C*** language, because that was what we knew the most.
Then I was playing a little bit with the ```awk``` command and figured out we could actually use that, so we can save tons of time to recreate basic functions
to solve this problem.
So after pitched the idea for my team mates we agreed to go with bash script and our strategy based on this ```awk``` command.
It worked out pretty well in the end, and we were able to solve task1 and task2.
